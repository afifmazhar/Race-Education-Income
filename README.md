# Race-Income-Education

This project was conducted utilizing a published dataset to analyze the trends between race, income, education differences in the United States. All coding was done in the R language.

# Executive Summary

An analysis of Race, Income, Education in the United States

This project is split into 4 major parts: Data collection and cleaning, Methods/Modeling, Visualizations, and Conclusion



# Part 1: Data Collection/Cleaning

We will be using the second-hand data from 2015 compiled by the Washington Post. The dataset consists of U.S Census information displaying the variables: Geographic area, City, percent White, percent Black, percent Native American, percent Asian, percent Hispanic, along with each cityâ€™s median household income, the graduation rate of cities with a population over 25 people, and percent below poverty level. This dataset was selected not only to highlight the different race percentages that exist per state and city, but to explain the level of which demographics play a role in poverty and consequently education. The data is consistently valid with minor null values, but overall variables are complete.

The data was split from 5 different csv files. The files were combined using excel and a VLOOKUP function to match the cities to their respective alignments in the columns. Data was cleaned through removing specific columns such as the "Geographic area," "City," "Police Killings Yes/No." All values were then changed to numeric values for ease of processing.


# Part 2: Modeling/Methods

Two methods were used to perpetrate the data for information. First, clustering was used to determine if it was the appropriate analysis technique. Data was normalized, clustered, and graphed.

The second, and most accurate method to analyze the data was multiple linear regression. Data was partitioned and modeled into a linear fit equation.

# Part 3: Visualizations

Data visualizations were included in the form of histograms, scatterplots, and box-and-whisker plots.


# Part 4: Conclusion



A cumulative paper is included.
